## What is This?
Bare-metal code written for the STM32 NUCLEO-F446RE. 

## Build Instructions
A cross compiler and toolchain is required to build. The build system assumes the presence of the
arm-none-eabihf toolchain. This can be overriden by changing the CROSS_COMPILER environment variable
before running make (e.g. CROSS_COMPILER=arm-none-eabi- make). The output directory can be altered from 
the default of build with the O environment variable.

- make: builds all targets
- make cc: cleans and generates compile_commands.json
- make clean: removes build artifacts
